Nowadays I have very little time to develope miau, so the developement is
likely to slow down for now. New version, written from scratch, is still
"coming", but I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you.

This release contains a few evil and known bugs, but as the release have been
peding for two months already, I've decided to release it anyway. "Release
early, release often." Better late than ever I guess.

See ChangeLog for a list of recent changes.
