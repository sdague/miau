Installing miau:

- Type './configure' to configure miau or './configure --enable-local'
  if you'd like to install miau locally in your account.
- Type 'make' to compile.
- Type 'make install' to install miau.

On SunOS 5.8, in case make fails, try running gmake, it should work.


ipv6 support is not automatically compiled in, as miau does not currently
support using both ipv4 and ipv6 protocols at once.  
Give '--enable-ipv6' to configure to enable it.

(See ./configure --help to change default-dirs for 'make install')


miau is in active development so visit the miau-site for new versions regularly.
