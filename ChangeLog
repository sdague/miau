0.5.4-p3 - "compatible catnap"

  * Fixed b0rken -c switch (crypt password)
  * Fixed qlog timestamp duplication
  * Fixed illegal memory access at nick generation (totally random)


0.5.4-p2 - "compatible catnap"

  * Use socklen_t (with automatic typedef for systems such as HPUX)
  * No more -O2 by default. Portability...
  * del_ignorebynumber (of ignore.c) now static, like prototype suggests.
  * hstrerror should no longer cause trouble on Digital UNIX. Keep your
    thumbs up!


0.5.4-p1 - "compatible catnap"

  * Removed traces of iconv and ENCODING stuff to make the thing compile on
    systems without iconv stuff installed...
  * Cast htonl to unsigned int before printfing %u.
  * Fixed compiling with QLOG but without INBOX.
  * Include unistd.h in dcc.h


0.5.4 - "catnap"

  * Channel keys defined in miaurc now have effect. Thanks to Ralf van der
    Enden.
  * Workaround for Chatzilla. Thanks to Oliver Eikemeier and James Ross.
  * Fixed channel mode change parser.
  * Fixed parser to handle CR-LF -linefeeds.
  * Fixed strlen(NULL) in match.c
  * Fixed double-freeing memory in free_resources
  * Added miaurc-options "floodtimer" and "burstsize" for configuring
    flood-protection.
  * Added an option for defining how many times miau should try to rejoin the
    channel. (Counter is reset on reconnect/attach.)
  * Preparing for major internal changes + clean-up for future
  * Fixed CTCP-replies, removed optional CTCP-replies
  * Have CTCP-replies by default (as some servers/networks require this)
  * No more entries in log about CTCP is client attached
  * Sends proper QUIT-message at SIGTERM
  * Source formatting...
  * foo(void) instead of foo(), fixed prototypes for signal handlers
  * Added stub for manual page


0.5.3 - "hairball"

  * Automatically generated logfilenames are now always in lower case.
  * miau now leaves channels (if configured to do so) when client times out and
    when client dropped connection.
  * After timeouted connect, miau no longer freezes until send() times out.
    How did I do this - after adding the timer?-)
  * miau no longer joins channels defined in miaurc at start-up if
    rejoin and leave are set to false.
  * Only one error message after connecting timed out.
  * No more skipping one server after connecting timed out.
  * Fixed handling of event-messages when "leave" is set to true.
  * Fixed memory-leak in chanlog_open(...). This occured only if global logtype
    failed to open logfile for writing.
  * Fixed proceed_timer_safe -- it was possible to make it never trigger return
    code 2.
  * Fixed bug that caused miau to free i_server.isupport[n] twice.
  * Lots of portability-cleanup (strict typecasting, got rid of (most?)
    "if (foo)"s etc.)
  * Installing miau locally no longer overwrites old config.
  * miau-rotatelog was removed from distribution package.
  * miau-check now uses locally installed miau by default.


0.5.2 - "fluffy little fellow"

  * Fixed a bug that caused miau to segfault on rehash if bind was defined while
    listenhost was not.
  * Message for dropping new client no longer contains garbage. Funny thing that
    neither valgrind nor electric fence caught this.
  * Rehashing now complains about all missing and required items.
  * Implemented timestamping for quicklog events (QLOGSTAMP).
    Option in miaurc: "timestamp", defines location of timestamp in quicklog
    events. May be one of "beginning", "end", or "none".
  * Implemented channel logging like logging for private messages (PRIVLOG).
    Channel log is now CHANLOG. "log" in miaurc is now "chanlog".
  * Logging finally handles "\1ACTION ...\1"s properly.
  * "getnick" option (in miaurc) now takes "never", "detached", "attached" and
    "always" as an argument.
  * Increased buffersize for error() and report(). Even server-error/kill should
    now fit in it.
  * Split log.[ch] into log.[ch], chanlog.[ch] and privlog.[ch].
  * Some parts of parser.c rewritten.
  * Improved dump_status() :-)
  * Code-cleanup.


0.5.1 - "y2k-compatible"

  * Quitting miau resulted in deadlock when logging was compiled in but not
    defined in miaurc. Fixed.
  * miau no longer tries to join channels when not connected.
    (There was one occasion this check wasn't done...)
  * When randomized nick was in use, error message told
    "Nick 'foobar' unavailable - using 'foobar^^" while miau had nick
    'foobar^'. Fixed.
  * Away-status is now set and unset properly. miau used to set/unset
    away-status even when it was not needed.
  * Empty away-message ("AWAY :") is now, by default, understood as "remove
    AWAY message". Empty AWAY messages can be allowed by giving
    --enable-empty-awaymsg (EMPTYAWAY) to configure-script.
  * If user is marked as being away, new client is told about this. Some IRC-
    clients like irssi won't even try to remove away-status unless they think
    user is away. This fixes this issue.
  * No more detectable (not even those static) memory leaks!
  * Number of connected clients is now both reported to clients and written
    into log when number changes (and if more than one client is allowed).
    Message order is also sensible now, first we tell what happened, then the
    number of connected clients.
  * When user issues DIE-command, reason is echoed to all clients.
  * PINGSTAT and DUMP are also listed in list of miau's commands.
  * miau no longer catches SIGKILL.
  * Added Sebastian Kienzl and Lee Hardy into copyright-part of client.c and
    server.c from where they were left out when miau.c got splitted.
  * Minor code clean-ups.


0.5.0-mk2 - "Mark 2"

  * STATUSDUMP now dump to clients as well.
  * New configure-option, --enable-statusdump (STATUSDUMP).
  * Fixed --enable-local that got broken in 0.2.0... "Oops."
  * Finally debianized for good.
  * Code clean-up.


0.5.0 - "so it begins"

  * Implemented flood protection for client and for miau's internal functions.
    miau should no longer be able to flood itself out from IRC-server.
  * auto-op was enhanced to auto-mode. miau can now commit up to three mode
    changes per command. Also filenames autoop.[ch] were renamed accordingly to
    automode.[ch] as well as AUTOOP was translated to AUTOMODE. I'm already
    planning to change the format (in miaurc) of this feature to gain some
    speed-up... Don't hold your breath, though.
  * If miau drops from the server (which we were already in) it tries to
    reconnect to it. If connection can't be established, miau moves to the
    next server in the list.
  * When defining permissions, "@@" can be used to define miau's public
    hostname.
  * Fixed bug in parser which caused entries in invalid list to be added to last
    succesfully defined list.
  * Should've fixed "qlog-for-this-channel-though-nothing-exists" -bug for good.
  * Using quicklog takes much less CPU-time than before.
  * Fixed illegal memory access in parser. (Check was done in wrong order.)
  * Received ERROR-message is now (finally) sent as part-reason to clients.
  * No longer "Received a CTCP ... (didn't reply)" -messages when compiling
    CTCPREPLIES disabled.
  * Code clean-up and optimization.
  * Almost complete debian/-directory.


0.4.7 - "another bug-free release ;-)"

  * Fixed "try to free non-allocated memory"-bug that revealed itself only when
    using gcc 2.95 instead of gcc 3.3.1.


0.4.6 - "a long road ahead"

  * Fixed a bug in "quit-reason to away-message" that tried to access already
    freed memory. How did I miss this ?-O
  * miau 0.4.5 started counting length of quicklog in seconds because of
    forgotten debug-code. Fixed.
  * Reloading miaurc (with only one server defined) while connecting to server
    made miau to access already freed memory. Fixed.
  * Since 0.4.0, miau have processed incorrect lines (like lines with too many
    parameters) in miaurc although complaining about them. Invalid lines are no
    longer parsed.
  * miau can now execute a command when connecting to server (like send a
    message to nickserv). Should we have same functionality for event when
    client connects to miau ?
  * All errors and notices that would be printed in log are now sent to clients.
  * RELEASENICK writes now a log-entry.
  * Legacy fix: replaced read and write with recv and send (whenever playing
    with sockets).
  * Fixes and updates in documentation.
  * Added a missing space to messages.h plus some other minor changes.
  * A few minor code clean-ups.
  * miau is now developed by using (GNU) autoconf 2.57, automake 1.7.6 and
    aclocal 1.7.6 instead of older versions.


0.4.5 - "bug-o-matic"

  * privmsglog fixed. If quicklog is being used, message is moved to privmsglog
    when appropriate quicklog-line would be discarded.
  * New configuration option: usequitmsg. This option enabled, quit-reason is
    used as away-message when all clients have disconnected from miau.
  * Client is now sent SERV_DROPPED instead of SERV_DISCONNECT when server
    closes connection.
  * Changed timestamp-format to "Mon dd hh:mm:ss"
  * Reverted "SIGPIPE"-fix in 0.4.4 back to normal - I completely forgot that
    we are signoring SIGPIPEs in the first place. This is what one gets when
    (s)he runs programs in gdb even while not actually debugging...
  * Splitted miau.c to miau.c, server.c, client.c and remote.c
  * Moved some type definitions and variables to appropriate files
  * Fixes and updates in documentation and miaurc.in


0.4.4 - "a new hope"

  * ERRONEUSNICKNAME no longer causes miau to quit - in fact, ERRONEUSNICKNAME
    only causes changing nick while registering to the server.
  * miau should, again, send a QUIT-message to server before closing the socket.
    However, if connection to server is believed lost, QUIT-message is not sent.
  * User's away-message is now preserved when miau drops from the server.
  * User's away-message is no longer removed when miau connects to the server.
    Note that if awaymsg is set and no clients are connected to miau, miau will
    set user away upon connect - and remove AWAY-message when user connects to
    miau. In this case user will, again, see his/hers away-status unset.
  * Queued auto-op-actions are now dropped when target user quits.
  * USER-message during server registeration no longer sends out server's name.
  * Fixed an illegal memory access -bug in configuration-file parser.
  * Fixed JUMP-command (that was broken somewhere around 0.3.0).
  * miau no longer crashes at start-up if MIAUDIR doesn't exist
  * Since 0.4.0 miau didn't complain about missing miaurc. Fixed.
  * Fixes in documentation plus some spellcheck.


0.4.3 - "I screwed up again, right?"

  * JOIN-message is now accepted both with and without preceeding column (':').


0.4.2 - "let the hunt begin"

  * Dropping the server didn't clear operator status. Fixed.
  * User never saw the actual message sent with ERROR. Fixed.
  * getting_nick -counter is now reset when connection to the server is
    established.
  * Fixes in documentation.


0.4.1

  * Fixed all-broken configuration file parser. I knew I should've tested
    misc/miaurc - things like this shouldn't happen...
  * NICKINUSE-messages are no longer written in quicklog. Should make life
    easier for irc-II -derivates.
  * Commented out #define DEBUG in miau.c


0.4.0

  * First of all, this release was supposed to be 0.3.3, honest, but at the end,
    I ended up doing way too much changes for this being 0.3.3.
  * miau now allows multiple clients at once.
  * Rewrote quicklog-thing to have "global" quicklog instead of channel-specific
    log. This way we can log _everything_ (like QUITs etc.) and not only
    channel related actions.
  * miau no longer takes commands while connecting a server - but instead,
    allows user to configure timeout for connect(). This is done to get rid of
    alarm() which probably messed up some read()s really bad and caused some
    weird network-related problems.
  * User can now join and part channels while not connected to server. miau
    will, respectively, add or remove channels to/from its internal list.
  * If miau is forced to leave from server, miau will now rejoin those channels.
    If a channel can not be joined right now, miau will try again later.
  * miau now stores and traces changes of channel keys.
  * miau should now know about its operator status when arriving on an empty
    channel.
  * Completely rewritten configuration-file parser. This means you have to
    rewrite your config-file, sorry about that. This change made (compiled) miau
    about 12 kB smaller.
  * New configuration options:
      - List (of arbitrary length) of preferred nicks.
      - Timeout before disconnecting from stoned server. (stonedtimeout)
      - Timeout for new connect(). (connecttimeout)
      - Delay between (server) connection attempts. (reconnectdelay)
      - Default user mode.
      - Global logfile postfix.
      - Character to use when generating a nick.
      - Maximum length for nick (for generated nicks).
      - Maximum number of clients connected
  * When connection to the server is lost, channels are left to keep client
    happy.
  * Changed behaviour of permission-lists to ruleset. This allows writing more
    flexible permissions.
  * Rewriting configuration file fixed an altnick-issue when changing a server.
  * Fixed a legacy bug related to client's receive buffer.
  * Logging can be defined to happen only when attached/detached.
  * More compile-time options: LOGGING and PRIVMSGLOG (plus, for debugging,
    ENDUSERDEBUG and PINGSTAT).
  * Many structures use linked list instead of a table. table.[ch] is a pain to
    use and will be removed completely in future.
  * Most lists are now flushed at rehash.
  * Wrote base for remote commands. Eww.
  	- cmdpasswd can now be hash, too.
  * Almost all memory is now freed at exit.
  * Some optimization.
  * dlink.[ch] renamed to llist.[ch].
  * Fixes in misc/miaurc.in + documentation.


0.3.2

  * Replaced POSIX-threads with a signal. :-) This way debugging will be easier
    _and_ miau will eat less memory (and appear in process list only once).
    So far the only drawback have been a slightly increased latency between miau
    and the user.
  * Mode-changes are now processed properly. This eliminates the problem of
    giving operator status to people, who got the status with "MODE +oo nick0
    nick1" and the problem of miau trying to give operator status without have
    one. The problem is, if miau enters an empty channel and gets operator
    status without mode-change, it doesn't know it...
    

0.3.1

  * Fixed empty join -bug.
  * Made changing server more verbose.
  * Removed some forgotten debug-information.


0.3.0

  * Big change: miau now uses additional POSIX-thread to listen the client
    while connection to the server is maintained in the main process. This
    allows user to interact with miau even when miau's not connected to the
    server. Also, miau no longer disconnects the client when changing the
    server etc.
  * Server-list is now flushed at rehash.
  * Removing current server from server-list no longer (did it ever ?-) makes
    miau drop connection from current server.
  * Changed a few strings.
  * Code clean-up.
  * Decided to number miau as x.y.z instead of x.y(-pre#)


0.2

  * miau should survive better even if pings to server are lost.
  * Cleaned up configure.ac
  * Fixed a definition bug (typo) in configure.ac
  * Traced most memory leaks (in numbers) to name_lookup.
  * miau should now eat _most_ error messages about ERR_NICKINUSE and
    ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE when trying to obtain the nick.
  * miau should no longer auto-ops people that are already op'd.
  	- checking mode-changes is not bullet-proof, only first mode change
  	  is noticed.
  * quicklog can be saved to messagelog when bouncer is to leave channel without
    user's command. This is disabled by default, because it is not tested very
    well. Use with caution.
  * Fixed a bug in server-handing code. (never over-optimize again. right... :-)
  * Wrote an extremly dirty hack to make miau compile Digital-UNIX. This _very_
    dirty hack does (in certain situations) cause buffer overflows. :p
  * miau.c splitted in pieces:
  	- autoop.[ch]
  * Code clean-up.
  * Fixed an error in messages.h


0.1

  * Fixed some memory issues inherited from muh (freed twice, zero byte
    allocation).
  * Removed some useless (no, really) code
  * miau now generated better pseudo-random nicks if defined nick are in use.
  * Feature to cache channel logs to replay them on connection to miau.
  * setaway-option implemented.
  * Anti-idle interval can now be configured.
  * All-infamous auto-operate -feature implemented.
  * Default permissions set to deny.
  * Cat-art in ascii.c  :-)
  * Die-command can be given quit-reason or the default one can be used.
  * Added compile-time options CTCP_REPLIES, UPTIME, MKPASSWD, ASCII_ART,
    RELEASENICK, QUICKLOG, AUTOOP and DCCBOUNCE.
