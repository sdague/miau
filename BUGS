Bugs:

- If quicklog expired for channel we got kicked out while detached, miau tells
  client to join this channel. The problem is that user is _not_ on this
  channel.

- irc.c/irc_write_real() { send() } may lock up if rehashed while connecting

- Fails silently if cannot write into ~/.miau/log
	- stdout is redirected into file we cannot write to!       


Bugs-to-be:

after "server closed connection" miau reconnected and sent
  "P:irc.kolumbus.fi 433 * wind :Nickname is already in use."
to client. After this, miau kind of ... froze.


After attaching to miau, user was on channels #tko-Ã¤ly (user wanted to be on
this channel) and #tko-.ly where "." was a character which X-Chat Aqua didn't
display. X-Chat Aqua couldn't part "#tko-ly" because it wasn't on such channel.
  This could be a bug in X-Chat Aqua - there already was another bug that was
  one of XCA's instead of miau's.
