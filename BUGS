Bugs:

- Receive buffer is not cleared when connection is lost

- QUIT is logged on every channel (ok fine it's a feature)

- If server changes user's nick, miau doesn't try to get it back!?

- Wildcard '*' matches one or more character, not any number as it's supposed
  to.

- dcc probably won't work with IPv6


Removed unconfirmed bugs from this list.
