Bugs:

- QUIT is logged on every channel (ok fine it's a feature)

- Stuff left unfreed if binding fails

- If server changes user's nick, miau doesn't try to get it back!?

- Wildcard '*' matches one or more character, not any number as it's supposed
  to.

- When forced to leave a channel (dead server etc.) channel cannot be removed
  from miau's internal list. When connection to a server is re-established,
  channels are rejoined even if user did "JOIN 0" meanwhile. It is likely that
  passive_channels are not cleared if rejoin is set to false and conf-file is
  reread...

- If quicklog expired for channel we got kicked out while detached, miau tells
  client to join this channel. The problem is that user is _not_ on this
  channel.

- Fails silently if cannot write into ~/.miau/log

- stdout is redirected into file we cannot write to!

- dcc probably won't work with IPv6


Removed unconfirmed bugs from this list.
