Bugs:

- if channels are defined, leave and rejoin are set to true, miau joins
  channels at startup although it should not.

- irc.c/irc_write_real() { send() } may lock up if rehashed while connecting

- fails silently if cannot write into ~/.miau/log
	- stdout is redirected into file we cannot write to!       


Bugs-to-be:

after "server closed connection" miau reconnected and sent
  "P:irc.kolumbus.fi 433 * wind :Nickname is already in use."
to client. After this, miau kind of ... froze.


After attaching to miau, user was on channels #tko-Ã¤ly (user wanted to be on
this channel) and #tko-.ly where "." was a character which X-Chat-Aqua didn't
display. X-Chat-Aqua couldn't part "#tko-ly" because it wasn't on such channel.
