Bugs:

- miau doesn't leave channels (when configured to do so) when client times out

- irc.c/irc_write_real() { send() } may lock up if rehashed while connecting

- fails silently if cannot write into ~/.miau/log
	- stdout is redirected into file we cannot write to!       


Bugs-to-be:


after "server closed connection" miau reconnected and sent
  "P:irc.kolumbus.fi 433 * wind :Nickname is already in use."
to client. After this, miau kind of ... froze.

rejoin/leave set to default, a few channels defined in miaurc
  - client-quit parts some channels in miaurc, some it doesn't
  - all channels not mentioned in miaurc were parted
  - channels we _were_ left on was commented out in miaurc!
