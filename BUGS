Bugs:

- When forced to leave a channel (dead server etc.) channel cannot be removed
  from miau's internal list. When connection to a server is re-established,
  channels are rejoined even if user did "JOIN 0" meanwhile. It is likely that
  passive_channels are not cleared if rejoin is set to false and conf-file is
  reread...
  
- If quicklog expired for channel we got kicked out while detached, miau tells
  client to join this channel. The problem is that user is _not_ on this
  channel.
	
- Fails silently if cannot write into ~/.miau/log

- stdout is redirected into file we cannot write to!


Unconfirmed bugs (and those I couldn't reproduce):

- Weird behaviour on FreeBSD where chanlog will be (partly?) compiled in while
  --enable-chanlog is _not_ given to configure.

- irc.c/irc_write_real() { send() } may lock up if rehashed while connecting

- miau _may_ crash after rehash
	- First time I found this after some network problems. I dropped from
	  IRC (network went down), changed username and stonedtimeout while
	  offline, then rehashed -> "reconnecting" -> crash.
	- I was able to reproduce this exactly once by launching miau,
	  connecting with client, changing username,
	  rehashing -> "reconnecting" -> crash.
	- miau fails at server_set_fallback() because safe->name can't be
	  accessed - looks like "safe" is inaccesable!
	- Electric fence nor valgrind can't find anything alarming (although
	  I didn't run them when I managed to reproduct this bug)

- miau joins weird channels
	- after attaching to miau, user was on channels #tko-äly (user wanted
	  to be on this channel) and #tko-.ly where "." was a character which
	  X-Chat Aqua didn't display. X-Chat Aqua couldn't part "#tko-ly"
	  because it wasn't on such channel.
	- This could be a bug in X-Chat Aqua - there already was another bug
	  that was one of XCA's instead of miau's.
	- Can't reproduce this

- Garbage sent to client
	- After "server closed connection" miau reconnected and sent
	  "P:irc.kolumbus.fi 433 * wind :Nickname is already in use."
	  to client. After this, miau kind of ... froze. I didn't wait long,
	  though, send() (or something else) might have timed out later on.
	- "--- #tko-äly warpman cs80220.pp.htv.fi *.tut.fi warpman G :irc.cs.hut.fi 433 * wind :Nickname is already in use."
	- on other occasion, xchat printed "#channel :foobar" - when xchat
	  receives bogus data from the server, it prints it out unhandeled
	  just like that.
	- Haven't been able to reproduce this

- More garbage
	- got
"away='h@ friendly'    awaystate=0    good_server=1    goodhostname=7"
	  from miau. after reconnect, everything was fine. even away-message
	  was set ok (after disconnect after this garbage)

- qlog_drop_old() (called by qlog_write() called by server.c after receiving
  ":No recipient given (PRIVMSG)") managed to segfault: qlog.head->data was
  non-NULL, but pointed to unallocated area.

- connecting to miau may send some unexpected stuff to client
	- stuff was stored in i_server.isupport[0] but memory was never
	  allocated in there
