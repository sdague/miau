TODO:

- repeat 352 only to person who requested it !
	- keep queue of "WHO #channel" -messages and echo following incoming 
	  352 / 315 only to this client

- supress echoed post-JOIN messages that certain clients are not interested
  about

- autojoin channels only if not dropping from server too ofter

- check other functions related to tables/ignore, there might be other
  useless things as well...

- cycle empty channels

- ascii-art from a file

- command to jump to certain server (irc.inet.fi etc.) ?

- onattach in addition to onconnect ?

- split source files into smaller

- see what happens if user, who's channel operator, tries to touch ircop.
  react to 484 only when connecting ?
	- apparently not neccessary

- fix anti-idle -thingie, now it works a bit illegal way...
	- perhaps this isn't an issue



NOTES TO SELF:

- ignore.[ch] are almost completely inside #ifdef CTCP_REPLIES

- process_ignores etc. is inside #ifdef CTCP_REPLIES



muh-TODO:

- consider the implications of the way we do logging.. is writing
  everything as we get it such a good idea?

  leeh->> rip the stuff from ircd-hybrid for formatting of ipv4-in-ipv6?

- message flood protection from dronenets

- option to ignore server notices in the messagelog
