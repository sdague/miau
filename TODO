TODO:

- support for CAPAB: strip out prefixes for clients that didn't ask for it

- write enduserdebug as a macro (like in log_cannot_write)

- try to reopen channel log file if not open already

- review autoaway...

- configure-option to disable forwardmsg

- user-tracking for decent QUIT log

- nicks-list should have nick-pairs for attached/detached -state

- reintroduce channels in specific order (order defined in miaurc)
	- alphabetical order
	- channels in miaurc, then channels from client in given order

- pack both ipv4- and ipv6-binaries in debian package

- cycle empty channels

- don't write ":No recipient given (PRIVMSG)" in qlog

- miaurc should have an option for ctcp-replies (if CTCPREPLIES is defined)

- repeat 352 only to client who requested it!
	- keep queue of "WHO #channel" -messages and echo following incoming 
	  352 / 315 only to this client

- supress echoed post-JOIN messages that certain clients are not interested
  about

- option to use PRIVMSG instead of NOTICE when playing messagelog
	- talk as "miau" like ENDUSERDEBUG?

- option to make miau send PRIVMSG on connect if messagelog exists

- randomize reconnect delay a little bit

- autojoin channels only if not dropping from server too ofter

- check other functions related to tables/ignore, there might be other
  useless things as well...

- ascii-art from a file

- command to jump to certain server (irc.inet.fi etc.) ?

- onattach in addition to onconnect ?

- split source files into smaller

- see what happens if user, who's channel operator, tries to touch ircop.
  react to 484 only when connecting ?
	- apparently not neccessary

- fix anti-idle -thingie, now it works a bit illegal way...
	- perhaps this isn't an issue

- consider following: "IRC messages are always lines of characters
  terminated with a CR-LF" (RFC 2812).

- Use ISON instead of plain NICK (as done in _old_ miaus)

- Reduce malloc()s and free()s by using static char[]s. As IRC limits length
  of messages, this _can_ be done. Hmm, do all server comply to this? They
  must, really.

- rewrite the whole thing...


NOTES TO SELF:

- ignore.[ch] are almost completely inside #ifdef CTCP_REPLIES

- process_ignores etc. is inside #ifdef CTCP_REPLIES



muh-TODO:

- consider the implications of the way we do logging.. is writing
  everything as we get it such a good idea?

- check the host allow stuff in relation to ipv6
  leeh->> rip the stuff from ircd-hybrid for formatting of ipv4-in-ipv6?

- message flood protection from dronenets

- option to ignore server notices in the messagelog

- vhost changing on the fly?
