See ChangeLog for stuff that has changed.


Notes:
- cmdpasswd and related things are space-sensitive.
- epic _may_ act funny when using getnick-feature.
- Automodes do not track nick-changes. if target changes nick, invalid
  mode-change will be done and error will be passed to the client.
- Don't reboot your Mac running X-Chat Aqua (2.0.5) unless you want to part
  _some_ of the channels you are on.


About multi-client support

DCC-requests also work, but there are a few things to consider:
  - When accepting a DCC-request, fastest client most likely gets it all.
    This may differ from (sending) client to client, because DCC-requests
    are sent to each client connected to miau and usually the other end
    (the one offering DCC) only accepts one connection.
  - When offering a DCC-something, offer is, unfortunately, echoed to each
    client and again, fastest gets it all - this means another client, with
    auto-accept on, connected to bouncer could get the file instead of the
    original target.
