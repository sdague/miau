  * Fixed privmsg_format behaviour with channels

    replies from server)
  * Fixed several unsafe va_list calls.

    'password = foo + "bar"'.
  * Parser will now print only one error per erroneous line.

  * Added miaurc option "qlog_no_my_quit" to suppress user's own QUIT messages
    when replaying quicklog.

miau (0.6.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed crash with channel modes with parameter(s) missing [#1644967]
  * Fixed "nothing goes to inbox after updating to 0.6.3"
  * miau now understands Undernet-style PART messages [#1676231]
  * Option to disconnect clients upon connecting to server. Should help with
    server reconnect issues with mIRC and certain IRC networks such as
    Afternet. [#1673149]
  * Added option "privmsg_fmt". When multiple clients are attached, probably
    only the initiator of private chat will see the message flow correctly.
    When this option is set, given prefix is inserted into private messages
    echoed to other attached users. (E.g. "<he> <- <other_me> hello".)
  * Wildcard '*' now matches to an empty string
  * Reset server timer when we receive data -- not just when PONG is received
  * Clear receive buffer before connecting to server. Oops.
  * Ping server more aggressively (at least every 45 seconds)
  * Open only privlog/fd for "user" and "User"

miau (0.6.3) unstable; urgency=low

    quicklog will be replayed (on attach).
  * Fixed user-provided privlog ignore-list
  * Now compiles with quicklog disabled
  * Finally got rid of bzeros
  * Fixed typo in misc/miaurc.in

miau (0.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed crash with qlog-to-inbox feature if inbox failed to open

  * Added command to replay specified amount of quicklog
  * Added command FLUSHQLOG to flush specified time from quicklog

  * Removed obsolete bits from README

 -- Tommi Saviranta <wnd@iki.fi>  Mon, 24 Jul 2006 20:39:59 +0300

miau (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatically generated logfilenames are now always in lower case.
  * miau now leaves channels (if configured to do so) when client times out and
    when client dropped connection.
  * After timeouted connect, miau no longer freezes until send() times out.
    How did I do this - after adding the timer?-)
  * miau no longer joins channels defined in miaurc at start-up if
    rejoin and leave are set to false.
  * Only one error message after connecting timed out.
  * No more skipping one server after connecting timed out.
  * Fixed handling of event-messages when "leave" is set to true.
  * Fixed memory-leak in chanlog_open(...). This occured only if global logtype
    failed to open logfile for writing.
  * Fixed proceed_timer_safe -- it was possible to make it never trigger return
    code 2.
  * Fixed bug that caused miau to free i_server.isupport[n] twice.
  * Lots of portability-cleanup (strict typecasting, got rid of (most?)
    "if (foo)"s etc.)
  * Installing miau locally no longer overwrites old config.
  * miau-rotatelog was removed from distribution package.
  * miau-check now uses locally installed miau by default.
  * miau-rotatelog removed from distribution package. 

 -- Tommi Saviranta <wind@kikai.katei>  Sun,  2 May 2004 16:13:56 +0300

miau (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that caused miau to segfault on rehash if bind was defined while
    listenhost was not.
  * Message for dropping new client no longer contains garbage. Funny thing that
    neither valgrind nor electric fence caught this.
  * Rehashing now complains about all missing and required items.
  * Implemented timestamping for quicklog events (QLOGSTAMP).
    Option in miaurc: "timestamp", defines location of timestamp in quicklog
    events. May be one of "beginning", "end", or "none".
  * Implemented channel logging like logging for private messages (PRIVLOG).
    Channel log is now CHANLOG. "log" in miaurc is now "chanlog".
  * Logging finally handles "\1ACTION ...\1"s properly.
  * "getnick" option (in miaurc) now takes "never", "detached", "attached" and
    "always" as an argument.
  * Increased buffersize for error() and report(). Even server-error/kill should
    now fit in it.
  * Split log.[ch] into log.[ch], chanlog.[ch] and privlog.[ch].
  * Some parts of parser.c rewritten.
  * Improved dump_status() :-)
  * Code-cleanup.

miau (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quitting miau resulted in deadlock when logging was compiled in but not
    defined in miaurc. Fixed.
  * miau no longer tries to join channels when not connected.
    (There was one occasion this check wasn't done...)
  * When randomized nick was in use, error message told
    "Nick 'foobar' unavailable - using 'foobar^^" while miau had nick
    'foobar^'. Fixed.
  * Away-status is now set and unset properly. miau used to set/unset
    away-status even when it was not needed.
  * Empty away-message ("AWAY :") is now, by default, understood as "remove
    AWAY message". Empty AWAY messages can be allowed by giving
    --enable-empty-awaymsg (EMPTYAWAY) to configure-script.
  * If user is marked as being away, new client is told about this. Some IRC-
    clients like irssi won't even try to remove away-status unless they think
    user is away. This fixes this issue.
  * No more detectable (not even those static) memory leaks!
  * Number of connected clients is now both reported to clients and written
    into log when number changes (and if more than one client is allowed).
    Message order is also sensible now, first we tell what happened, then the
    number of connected clients.
  * When user issues DIE-command, reason is echoed to all clients.
  * PINGSTAT and DUMP are also listed in list of miau's commands.
  * miau no longer catches SIGKILL.
  * Added Sebastian Kienzl and Lee Hardy into copyright-part of client.c and
    server.c from where they were left out when miau.c got splitted.
  * Minor code clean-ups.

miau (0.5.0-mk2) unstable; urgency=low

  * STATUSDUMP now dump to clients as well.
  * New configure-option, --enable-statusdump (STATUSDUMP).
  * Fixed --enable-local that got broken in 0.2.0... "Oops."
  * Finally debianized for good.
  * Code clean-up.
  * Finally properly debianized version.

 -- Tommi Saviranta <tsaviran@cs.helsinki.fi>  Tue, 13 Jan 2004 20:31:19 +0200

miau (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented flood protection for client and for miau's internal functions.
    miau should no longer be able to flood itself out from IRC-server.
  * auto-op was enhanced to auto-mode. miau can now commit up to three mode
    changes per command. Also filenames autoop.[ch] were renamed accordingly to
    automode.[ch] as well as AUTOOP was translated to AUTOMODE. I'm already
    planning to change the format (in miaurc) of this feature to gain some
    speed-up... Don't hold your breath, though.
  * If miau drops from the server (which we were already in) it tries to
    reconnect to it. If connection can't be established, miau moves to the
    next server in the list.
  * When defining permissions, "@@" can be used to define miau's public
    hostname.
  * Fixed bug in parser which caused entries in invalid list to be added to last
    succesfully defined list.
  * Should've fixed "qlog-for-this-channel-though-nothing-exists" -bug for good.
  * Using quicklog takes much less CPU-time than before.
  * Fixed illegal memory access in parser. (Check was done in wrong order.)
  * Received ERROR-message is now (finally) sent as part-reason to clients.
  * No longer "Received a CTCP ... (didn't reply)" -messages when compiling
    CTCPREPLIES disabled.
  * Code clean-up and optimization.
  * Almost complete debian/-directory.
  * First debianized version.
